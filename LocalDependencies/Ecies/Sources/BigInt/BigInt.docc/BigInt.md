## Overview

The BigInt package provides arbitrary-precision integer and fraction arithmetic in Swift:

* **Integer arithmetic and functions**

    Please, see <doc:AboutBInt>

* **Fraction arithmetic and functions**

    Please, see <doc:AboutBFraction>

* **Chinese Remainder Theorem**

    Please, see <doc:AboutCRT>

### Usage

To use BigInt, in your project Package.swift file add a dependency like

```swift
dependencies: [
  package(url: "https://github.com/leif-ibsen/BigInt", from: "1.17.0"),
]
```

BigInt itself does not depend on other packages.

> Important:
BigInt requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the `Int` and `UInt` types be 64 bit types.
