# About BFraction

Signed fractions with numerator and denominator of unbounded size

## Overview

Fractions are represented as ``BigInt/BFraction`` values consisting of a ``BigInt/BInt`` numerator value and a ``BigInt/BInt`` denominator value. The representation is normalized:

* The numerator and denominator have no common factors except 1
* The denominator is always positive
* Zero is represented as 0/1

### Creating BFraction's

```swift
// From its numerator and denominator
let f = BFraction(17, 4)

// From its decimal value
let f = BFraction(4.25)

// From its string representation
let f = BFraction("4.25")!
// or equivalently
let f = BFraction("425E-2")!

// From a continued fraction
let f = BFraction([3, 4, 12, 4])  // f = 649 / 200
```

Defining a fraction by specifying its decimal value might lead to surprises,
because not all decimal values can be represented exactly as a floating point number.

One might think that `BFraction(0.1)` would equal 1/10,
but in fact it equals 3602879701896397 / 36028797018963968 = 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625

On the other hand `BFraction("0.1")!` equals 1/10.

### Converting BFraction's

BFraction values can be converted to String values, to decimal String values, to Double values and to Continued Fraction values.

```swift
let x = BFraction(1000, 7)

// To String
let s1 = x.asString() // s1 = "1000 / 7"

// To decimal String
let s1 = x.asDecimalString(precision: 8, exponential: false) // s1 = "142.85714"
let s2 = x.asDecimalString(precision: 8, exponential: true) // s2 = "1.4285714E+2"

// To Double
let d = x.asDouble() // d = 142.8571428571429

// To Continued Fraction
let f = x.asContinuedFraction() // f = [BInt(142), BInt(1), BInt(6)]
```

### Operations

The operations available to `BFraction` are:

* **Arithmetic:** addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus
* **Comparison:** The six standard operations ==  !=  <  <=  >  >=
* **Rounding:** Rounding fractions to integers
* **Miscellaneous:** Bernoulli Numbers, Harmonic Numbers

### Bernoulli Numbers

The static function

```swift
let Bn = BFraction.bernoulli(n)
```

computes the n'th (n >= 0) Bernoulli number, which is a rational number.

For example

```swift
print(BFraction.bernoulli(60))
print(BFraction.bernoulli(60).asDecimalString(precision: 20, exponential: true))
```

would print

```swift
-1215233140483755572040304994079820246041491 / 56786730
-2.1399949257225333665E+34
```
The static function

```swift
let x = BFraction.bernoulliSequence(n)
```

computes the n even numbered Bernoulli numbers B(0), B(2) ... B(2 * n - 2).

### Harmonic Numbers

The static function

```swift
let Hn = BFraction.harmonic(n)
```

computes the n'th harmonic number, that is, 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n

The static function

```swift    
let x = BFraction.harmonicSequence(n)
```

returns an array containing the first n harmonic numbers.
